# EasyTransfer
Quick and easy to use command line tool.

# What it is?

This is a simple to use command line FTP tool. This can help you if you do not want to install any FTP manager because you just need to upload
few files... This works via CLI interface using Click library. Please note this is still in "in progress" state and it can do only basic function
(and that also dont work at all xd). Please consider waiting for the next release to use it!

# How?

Just by passing command like this: python ftp_transfer.py --server server.name.ip --username username --password serverPass --file C:\Users\xyz\documentXYZ.xyz

```html
--server > sets server ip
--username > sets username for login
--password > sets password for login

You can find theese (and more in the future :D) if you type command help.
To install and run, just download the folder, locate the file on your computer and run it as usuanl with the Python 3.x.
